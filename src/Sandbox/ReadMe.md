# My Sandbox Project

In this project, I'm exploring various aspects of programming in C#. Here's what I've learned so far....

- How `Parse()` and `TryParse()` work in the [`Fraction` class](./WhyTryParse/Fraction.cs).
- How to code an `enum` in the [`Rating` sample](./WhyTryParse/Rating.cs)
- Inheritance through the [`BaseClass`](./Inheritance/BaseClass.cs) and the [`DerivedClass`](./Inheritance/DerivedClass.cs)
- How File I/O works in the [`DemoFileIO` demo](./File-IO/DemoFileIO.cs)
